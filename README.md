## üöÄ Quick start

The fastest way to start using Openkoda is to run the system with Docker Compose scripts and a Docker image that contains all the necessary prerequisites: Java, PostgreSQL, and Openkoda.

Make sure Docker Compose is installed on your system.

To download and start the complete system image, simply run this command in your terminal:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openkoda/openkoda/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -f - up
```

Once the startup is complete, you can access the Openkoda web application at the following local URL:
```
https://localhost:8080
```
Log in as an Administrator using the default credentials: **login: admin** and **password: admin123**.

### Importing Openkoda application template

You may find some existing sample application templates in the [examples](https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda/tree/main/examples) directory in this repository.

Download the selected application package (as a .zip archive), then import the application within the Openkoda web interface by selecting: **Configuration > Import/Export** from the menu.

**Note:** If the only message you see after starting the import process is "IMPORT FILE," it may indicate that no components were found in the uploaded package, or the .zip file is corrupted or empty. Double-check that the file is not empty on your local filesystem before uploading.



## üíæ Installation 


### Installation options

There are two installation options to start application development with Openkoda:
* Running as a Docker container
* Building from sources


### Option #1: Run as a Docker Container

Docker images are available at Docker Hub : https://hub.docker.com/r/openkoda/openkoda

Download the latest version of the Openkoda Docker image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull openkoda/openkoda:latest
```

Please note that in that case Postgres needs to be already in place and `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` env variables need to be adjusted when running docker ([see Docker Hub for detailed options](https://hub.docker.com/r/openkoda/openkoda))

#### Docker compose

A simpler option may be to use the Docker Compose scripts located in the: `./docker/docker-compose.yaml` and `./docker/docker-compose-no-db.yaml` - depending on your preference, with or without Postgres as a part of the docker service. Here is a useful one-liner :
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openkoda/openkoda/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -f - up
```

### Option #2: Build from Sources

Prerequisites:

Git, Java 17, Maven 3.8+, PostgreSQL 14+

1. Create an empty PostgreSQL database
2. [Clone or download this Git repository](https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda.git)
3. Build application with maven:
```
mvn -f openkoda/pom.xml clean install spring-boot:repackage -DskipTests
```
4. Initialize the database in a first run:
```
java -Dloader.path=/BOOT-INF/classes -Dspring.profiles.active=openkoda,drop_and_init_database -jar build/openkoda.jar --server.port=<http port>
```
5. Run Openkoda 
```
java -Dloader.path=/BOOT-INF/classes -Dsecure.cookie=false -jar build/openkoda.jar --spring.profiles.active=openkoda --server.port=<http port>
```

Detailed instructions can be found in the [Installation](https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda/blob/main/openkoda/doc/installation.md) manual.

### Running dev/test instance without https

Openkoda uses strict secure cookies setting to increase security.

If you want to run a development/test instance of Openkoda without https and not using localhost then you need to disable secure cookies setting by:

* Set the SECURE_COOKIE environment variable to false before starting docker compose, eg. SET SECURE_COOKIE=false (windows), SECURE_COOKIE=false (linux)
* You may need to delete your locally cached Openkoda docker images with docker rmi
* Then proceed as described here: https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-compose


### Resolving installation issues

If you encounter any issues during the installation or when running Openkoda for the first time, please:

* Review the existing GitHub tickets, as a similar problem may have been reported before.
* If not, raise a new ticket, including steps to reproduce the issue and relevant logs‚Äîour development team regularly reviews reported issues.

## ‚úÖ Features

To significantly reduce development time and effort, Openkoda offers pre-built functionality and out-of-the-box features.

(*enterprise options)

### üßë‚Äçüíª Enterprise Application Foundation

Build your application without losing time on functionality every application always needs. Start with authentication, user management, multitenancy, and admin dashboard already in place.

#### Openkoda Industry-Specific Application Templates

Start with our pre-built domain-specific Openkoda application templates giving you a solid base to build your custom applications. Get an enterprise foundation with a predefined data model, useful dashboards, and ready-to-use business features.

#### Customize and Extend Using Open-Source Java, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL

Extend your application with open-source, scalable, and high-performance Java and JavaScript (back-end), HTML/CSS (front-end), and PostgreSQL (database).

#### *Data Model Builder: Customize Your Data Model and Views with Development Kit UI

Easily update, rename, and create new tables and attributes in your custom data model using our Development Kit UI. Use our intelligent editor with an autocomplete feature to choose from a variety of data types, create dropdowns, multiselect, or conditional types of fields. All inputs are validated, and your changes are applied immediately to both UI and the database.

Dynamically configure your data screens ‚Äì decide which attributes should be presented on the entity‚Äôs UI screen and which ones should be used as filters.

#### Dashboard Builder: Create Your Own Data Dashboards with Drag & Drop

Create useful dashboards for different user types and different organizations using pre-built widgets. Design custom views by combining widgets, images, and data tables in our drag & drop visual editor.

#### Modify Look & Feel of Your Application with Custom HTML/CSS

Craft a unique user experience by customizing HTML/CSS of your Openkoda application.

#### *Custom Business Logic

#### Role-Based Security Model

Define and manage user roles based on access privileges defined on the application, organization, table, individual object attribute, application view or at any other level. Create a precisely secured environment for your coworkers, customers and partners.

#### Custom Privileges

Define your custom access privileges types from UI to configure even more adjusted and secured environment.

### üè¢Scalable Multitenancy
